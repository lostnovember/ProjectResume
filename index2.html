            <p>My name is James Kendrick and I was born in North Carolina into a military family. 
            Our family moved all over the world and the United States until my father retired from the Air Force. 
            Deciding that college was not for me after high school, I too enlisted in the Air Force.
            Unfortunately, I sustained an injury that cut my service short. 
            This injury, however, has opened the opportunity to devote my energy to pursuing multiple degrees from the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. </p>

            <br>     
    
            <p>In my spare time, you can usually find me golfing, going to concerts, traveling with my wife, and watching Flordia State Football. 
            Chasing a little white ball around a manicured green pasture with eighteen holes in it seems frustrating to some, but not me. 
            I really enjoy the challenge of the game! Going to live concerts is always a thrill. 
            I have been lucky enough to take in two separate Coachella Valley Music Festivals and really want to go to other big festivals. 
            Traveling opens our minds to different perspectives that we wouldn’t otherwise see. My wife and I enjoy traveling in many ways. 
            Whether we are traveling by car, plane or ship; getting out to see what the world has to offer is always an exciting time. </p>
